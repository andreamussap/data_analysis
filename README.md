# Introduction

This repository is to store projects related to data (transformation, visualization, analysis) and tools to work with data.

***Note:** I'm treating each folder in this repository as a project.*

> _"Everybody needs data literacy because data is everywhere. Itâ€™s the new currency, it's the language of the business. We need to be able to speak that._"
