This repository is to store projects related to data transformation, analysis, and visualization.

# Why data

This quote from [Piyanka Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyanka/) summarizes why I'm interested in learning data analysis -

> _Everybody needs data literacy because data is everywhere. Itâ€™s the new currency, it's the language of the business. We need to be able to speak that._

# Projects in this repository

I'm treating each folder in this repository as a project.

The following lists the projects in this repository:

* Dataset transformation using Python's library `pandas`. ([Link](/python_BIDA/README.md))
* Visualization and analysis using Tableau. ([Link](/tableau_BIDA/README.md))
